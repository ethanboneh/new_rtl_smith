Otherwise, it is set to 0.\n\nGive me the complete code.\n"}, "clean_code": "`timescale 1ns/1ns\n\nmodule accu(\n    input               clk         ,   \n    input               rst_n       ,\n    input       [7:0]   data_in     ,\n    input               valid_in     ,\n \n    output  reg         valid_out     ,\n    output  reg [9:0]   data_out\n);\n    \n   reg [1:0] count;\n   wire add_cnt;\n   wire ready_add;\n   wire end_cnt;\n   reg [9:0]   data_out_reg;\n\n   assign add_cnt = ready_add;\n   assign end_cnt = ready_add && (count == 'd3);\n   \n   //count\n   always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n       if(!rst_n) begin\n          count <= 0;\n       end\n       else if(end_cnt) begin\n          count <= 0;\n       end\n       else if(add_cnt) begin\n          count <= count + 1;\n       end\n   end\n\n    //data_out_reg\n   always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n      if(!rst_n) begin\n        data_out_reg <= 0;\n      end\n      else if (add_cnt && count == 0) begin\n          data_out_reg <= data_in;\n      end\n      else if (add_cnt) begin\n          data_out_reg <= data_out_reg + data_in;\n      end\n   end\n\n    //data_out\n   always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n      if(!rst_n) begin\n        data_out <= 0;\n      end\n      else if (add_cnt && count == 0) begin\n          data_out <= data_in;\n      end\n      else if (add_cnt) begin\n          data_out <= data_out + data_in;\n      end\n   end\n\n   //ready_add\n   assign ready_add = !valid_out | valid_in;\n\n   //valid_out\n   always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n       if(!rst_n) begin\n           valid_out <= 0;\n       end\n       else if(end_cnt) begin\n           valid_out <= 1;\n       end\n       else begin\n           valid_out <= 0;\n       end\n   end  \n     \nendmodule", "corrupted_code": "`timescale 1ns/1ns\n\nmodule accu(\n    input               clk         ,   \n    input               rst_n       ,\n    input       [7:0]   data_in     ,\n    input               valid_in     ,\n \n    output  reg         valid_out     ,\n    output  reg [9:0]   data_out\n);\n    \n   reg [1:0] count;\n   wire add_cnt;\n   wire ready_add;\n   wire end_cnt;\n   reg [9:0]   data_out_reg;\n\n   assign add_cnt = ready_add;\n   assign end_cnt = ready_add && (count == 'd3);\n   \n   //count\n   always @(posedge clk or rst_n) begin\n       if(!rst_n) begin\n          count <= 0;\n       end\n       else if(end_cnt) begin\n          count <= 0;\n       end\n       else if(add_cnt) begin\n          count <= count + 1;\n       end\n   end\n\n    //data_out_reg\n   always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n      if(!rst_n) begin\n        data_out_reg <= 0;\n      end\n      else if (add_cnt && count == 0) begin\n          data_out_reg <= data_in;\n      end\n      else if (add_cnt) begin\n          data_out_reg <= data_out_reg + data_in;\n      end\n   end\n\n    //data_out\n   always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n      if(!rst_n) begin\n        data_out <= 0;\n      end\n      else if (add_cnt && count == 0) begin\n          data_out <= data_in;\n      end\n      else if (add_cnt) begin\n          data_out <= data_out + data_in;\n      end\n   end\n\n   //ready_add\n   assign ready_add = !valid_out | valid_in;\n\n   //valid_out\n   always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n       if(!rst_n) begin\n           valid_out <= 0;\n       end\n       else if(end_cnt) begin\n           valid_out <= 1;\n       end\n       else begin\n           valid_out <= 0;\n       end\n   end  \n     \nendmodule", "corruption_explanation": "Modified sensitivity list", "modification_type": "change_sensitivity_list", "modification_line": 23, "original_snippet": "always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n)", "modified_snippet": "always @(posedge clk or rst_n)", "issue_description": "The buggy code has an incorrect or incomplete sensitivity list.

When the pedestrian button is pressed, if the remaining green time is greater than 10 clocks, it is shortened to 10 clocks, and if it is less than 10 clocks, it remains unchanged. The lane light and the sidewalk light should be paired, when the lane light is green or yellow, the sidewalk light is red; When the lane light is red, the sidewalk light is green, and for the sake of simplicity, only the lane light is considered.\n\nModule name:  \n    traffic_light\n\nInputs:\n    rst_n: Reset signal (active low).\n    clk: Clock signal.\n    pass_request: Request signal for allowing vehicles to pass.\n\nOutputs:\n    clock[7:0]: An 8-bit output representing the count value of the internal counter.\n    red, yellow, green: Output signals representing the state of the traffic lights.\n\nParameters:\n    idle, s1_red, s2_yellow, s3_green: Enumeration values representing different states of the traffic light controller.\n\nRegisters and Wires:\n    cnt: A 8-bit register used as an internal counter for timing purposes.\n    state: A 2-bit register representing the current state of the traffic light controller.\n    p_red, p_yellow, p_green: 1-bit registers representing the next values for the red, yellow, and green signals.\n\nImplementation:\nThe following is the design track we recommend:\nThe first always block is responsible for the state transition logic. It uses a case statement to handle different states. Here's a summary of each state:\nidle: Initial state where all signals are set to 0. Transition to s1_red state occurs immediately.\ns1_red: Sets the red signal to 1 and waits for a count of 3 before transitioning to s3_green state. Otherwise, it remains in s1_red state.\ns2_yellow: Sets the yellow signal to 1 and waits for a count of 3 before transitioning to s1_red state. Otherwise, it remains in s2_yellow state.\ns3_green: Sets the green signal to 1 and waits for a count of 3 before transitioning to s2_yellow state. Otherwise, it remains in s3_green state.\nThe second always block handles the counting logic of the internal counter (cnt). The counter is decremented by 1 on every positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset signal.

When the pedestrian button is pressed, if the remaining green time is greater than 10 clocks, it is shortened to 10 clocks, and if it is less than 10 clocks, it remains unchanged. The lane light and the sidewalk light should be paired, when the lane light is green or yellow, the sidewalk light is red; When the lane light is red, the sidewalk light is green, and for the sake of simplicity, only the lane light is considered.\n\nModule name:  \n    traffic_light\n\nInputs:\n    rst_n: Reset signal (active low).\n    clk: Clock signal.\n    pass_request: Request signal for allowing vehicles to pass.\n\nOutputs:\n    clock[7:0]: An 8-bit output representing the count value of the internal counter.\n    red, yellow, green: Output signals representing the state of the traffic lights.\n\nParameters:\n    idle, s1_red, s2_yellow, s3_green: Enumeration values representing different states of the traffic light controller.\n\nRegisters and Wires:\n    cnt: A 8-bit register used as an internal counter for timing purposes.\n    state: A 2-bit register representing the current state of the traffic light controller.\n    p_red, p_yellow, p_green: 1-bit registers representing the next values for the red, yellow, and green signals.\n\nImplementation:\nThe following is the design track we recommend:\nThe first always block is responsible for the state transition logic. It uses a case statement to handle different states. Here's a summary of each state:\nidle: Initial state where all signals are set to 0. Transition to s1_red state occurs immediately.\ns1_red: Sets the red signal to 1 and waits for a count of 3 before transitioning to s3_green state. Otherwise, it remains in s1_red state.\ns2_yellow: Sets the yellow signal to 1 and waits for a count of 3 before transitioning to s1_red state. Otherwise, it remains in s2_yellow state.\ns3_green: Sets the green signal to 1 and waits for a count of 3 before transitioning to s2_yellow state. Otherwise, it remains in s3_green state.\nThe second always block handles the counting logic of the internal counter (cnt). The counter is decremented by 1 on every positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset signal. The counter values are adjusted based on various conditions:\nIf (!rst_n), the counter is set to 10.\nIf the pass_request signal is active and the green signal is active, the counter is set to 10.\nIf the green signal is inactive and the previous green signal (p_green) was active, the counter is set to 60.\nIf the yellow signal is inactive and the previous yellow signal (p_yellow) was active, the counter is set to 5.\nIf the red signal is inactive and the previous red signal (p_red) was active, the counter is set to 10.\nOtherwise, the counter is decremented normally.\nThe assign statement assigns the value of the internal counter (cnt) to the output clock.\nThe final always block handles the output signals. It assigns the previous values (p_red, p_yellow, p_green) to the output signals (red, yellow, green) on the positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset signal.\n\nGive me the complete
