  You are a verification engineer writing a bug report for a SystemVerilog RTL design issue.

  Given the original (clean) code and the buggy code, write a concise but detailed issue description that:
  1. Clearly describes what the bug is
  2. Explains when/under what conditions the bug manifests
  3. Describes the expected behavior vs. the actual incorrect behavior
  4. Optionally mentions what specific test cases or scenarios would fail
  5. If applicable, mentions what linting rule or RTL design principle was violated

  Write the issue description in a clear, professional style similar to a GitHub issue or bug tracker entry.

  Your response should be formatted as follows:
