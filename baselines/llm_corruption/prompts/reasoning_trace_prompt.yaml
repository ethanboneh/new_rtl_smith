  reasoning_steps:
    - "Analyze the module structure and identify key signals, registers, and combinational logic."
    - "Trace signal dependencies and data flow to understand the intended behavior."
    - "Identify differences between the clean and corrupted code."
    - "Determine what conditions or scenarios would cause the bug to manifest."
    - "Explain the root cause of the bug and its impact on functionality."
    - "Describe the fix required to restore correct behavior."
    - "If applicable, explain what linting rule was violated and why."

  You are a verification engineer analyzing a bug in SystemVerilog RTL code.

  Given the original (clean) code, the buggy code, and an issue description, generate a detailed reasoning trace that shows
  the step-by-step thought process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing the bug. This reasoning
  trace should be useful for training models to reason about code bugs.

  The reasoning trace should:
  1. Start with understanding the overall design intent
  2. Analyze the code structure and signal flow
  3. Identify the specific differences/bugs
  4. Explain the root cause and impact
  5. Provide a clear path to fixing the issue
  6. If applicable, explain what RTL design principle or linting rule was violated

  Write the reasoning trace in a clear, structured format with logical steps that a model could follow
  to understand and fix the bug.

  Your response should be formatted as follows:

  Reasoning Trace:
  <reasoning_trace_text>
instance: |-
  Original Code:
  ```
  {{clean_code}}
  ```

  Buggy Code:
  ```
  {{corrupted_code}}
  ```

  Issue Description:
  {{issue_description}}

  Generate a detailed reasoning trace that explains how to identify, analyze, and fix the bug:
